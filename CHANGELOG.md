# Changelog

All notable changes to agentic-config.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.14] - 2025-12-26

### Added

- `install.sh` - curl-installable script for single-command global installation
  - Clones/updates repo to `~/.agents/agentic-config` (configurable via `AGENTIC_CONFIG_DIR`)
  - Pre-flight checks for git and OS compatibility (macOS/Linux)
  - Colored terminal output with clear next steps after installation
  - Handles both fresh installs and updates gracefully
  - `--dry-run` flag for preview mode (no changes made)
- `chore` GitHub label (#a2eeef) for maintenance and housekeeping tasks (#15)
- `--with-squashed-commits` flag for `/milestone` to opt-in include squashed commit references (#14)
- `.gitignore` patterns to prevent tracking invalid nested symlinks in `core/`
- `cleanup_invalid_nested_symlinks()` function in `update-config.sh` for automatic cleanup
- Pre-cleanup step in `/init` command to remove invalid symlinks before creating new ones
- `validate_symlink_target()` function in `setup-config.sh` to prevent creating symlinks inside source directories

### Changed

- Default install location from `~/projects/agentic-config` to `~/.agents/agentic-config` (hidden directory, standard for user configs)
- README Quickstart section now uses curl install pattern as primary installation method
- `/init` command simplified to post-clone symlink repair only (no longer runs global install)
- `setup-config.sh` and `update-config.sh` no longer install `agentic-*` commands (now globally installed via `install.sh`)
- `/full-life-cycle-pr` now uses `/po_spec` instead of `/o_spec` for phased orchestration (#13)
- `/milestone` now excludes squashed commit references by default (use `--with-squashed-commits` to include) (#14)
- README quickstart step 4 now includes explicit `claude` command before `/agentic setup`

### Fixed

- UUID generation parse errors in shell commands across 6 files - replaced `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` with POSIX-safe `tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'` (#11)
- CLI validation for `--type-checker` and `--linter` flags in `setup-config.sh` - now rejects invalid values (#7)
- Command injection risk in `setup-config.sh` - replaced `eval "$detected"` with safe grep/cut parsing (#7)
- Pipe character escaping in `template-processor.sh` sed pattern (#7)
- Invalid self-referential symlinks being created inside `core/agents/` and `core/skills/` directories

## [0.1.13] - 2025-12-26

### Added

- `/po_spec` command for phased spec orchestration (multi-phase feature decomposition with DAG execution)
- `product-manager` skill for decomposing large features into concrete development phases
- `--auto` flag for `/milestone` to skip all confirmation gates (autonomous execution)
- Workflow state persistence for `/full-life-cycle-pr`, `/o_spec`, and `/po_spec` commands
  - Session-based state tracking in `outputs/orc/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{HHMMSS}-{UUID}/workflow_state.yml`
  - Automatic resume detection for interrupted workflows
  - AI-interpreted state updates with current step/stage tracking
  - Orchestrator behavioral constraints to enforce delegation pattern

### Changed

- `/full-life-cycle-pr` now passes `--auto` to `/milestone` for fully autonomous execution after initial confirmation
- Single confirmation gate design: user confirms once at start, then workflow runs to completion
- `/full-life-cycle-pr` now creates session directories and maintains workflow state for resume capability
- `/o_spec` now maintains workflow state with per-stage tracking across all modifiers (full/normal/lean/leanest)

### Fixed

- `/fork-terminal` security vulnerability: prevents dangerous execution in system directories
  - PATH argument now optional with safe default `/tmp/claude/<uuid>`
  - Validates PATH before execution to reject root (/) and system directories (/bin, /usr, /etc, /System, /sbin, /Library)
  - Automatically creates isolated temporary directory with UUID when PATH not provided
  - Clear error messages on invalid paths with safe invocation examples in SAFETY section

## [0.1.12] - 2025-12-18

## [0.1.7] - 2025-12-17

### Added
