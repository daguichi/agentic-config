  - `discover_agentic_path`: Priority-based discovery algorithm across all locations
  - `persist_to_dotpath`: Creates `~/.agents/.path` with absolute installation path
  - `persist_to_shell_profile`: Adds export to shell profiles with idempotency (bash/zsh)
  - `persist_to_xdg_config`: Creates XDG-compliant config at `~/.config/agentic/config`
  - Marker-based idempotency prevents duplicate shell profile entries
- Agentic root discovery library (`core/lib/agentic-root.sh`) for finding installation root
  - `get_agentic_root`: Walks up directory tree to find agentic-config installation
  - Looks for `VERSION` marker file and `core/` directory
  - Git repository root fallback when VERSION file exists there
  - Enables commands/skills to work from any nested directory or git worktree
- Config loader library (`core/lib/config-loader.sh`) for unified configuration loading
  - Priority order: Environment variables > `.env` > `.agentic-config.conf.yml`
  - `load_agentic_config`: Loads all config with priority resolution
  - `get_agentic_config`: Get specific value with priority lookup

- `/dry-run` skill for simulating command execution without file modifications
  - Sets dry_run flag in session state, executes commands with read-only constraint
  - Prevents all file writes except outputs/session/status.yml during simulation
  - Useful for testing workflows safely (e.g., `/dry-run /po_spec path/to/spec.md`)
- Pretooluse hook for hard enforcement of dry-run mode
  - Blocks Write, Edit, NotebookEdit tools when dry_run flag is enabled
  - Analyzes Bash commands to detect file-writing operations
  - Session status file (outputs/session/status.yml) exempt from blocking
  - Fail-open principle: allows operations on errors to prevent blocking legitimate work
  - Installed automatically during setup, migrate, and update workflows
- Source file validation in `/agentic update nightly` symlink rebuild
  - Validates source files exist before creating symlinks
  - Skips missing files with clear reporting to prevent broken symlinks
- `install.sh --nightly` flag to skip git reset and use local state (for development)
- `install.sh` positional argument for custom installation path (e.g., `bash -s -- /custom/path`)
- Config reconciliation function (`reconcile_config`) in version-manager.sh
  - Adds missing fields to `.agentic-config.json` without overwriting existing values

### Changed

- `.agentic-config.json` schema now includes `agentic_global_path` field for project-local discovery
- Agentic root discovery (`core/lib/agentic-root.sh`) enhanced with 6-level priority algorithm:
  1. `$AGENTIC_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable (if set)
  2. `~/.agents/.path` file (simple text file)
  3. `~/.config/agentic/config` (XDG-compliant)
  4. `.agentic-config.json` in current project (`agentic_global_path` field)
  5. PWD traversal for `VERSION` + `core/` markers (backward compatibility)
  6. Default fallback: `$HOME/.agents/agentic-config`
- Installation scripts now persist `AGENTIC_CONFIG_PATH` to multiple locations for robust discovery
  - `install.sh` calls `persist_agentic_path` after successful installation
  - `scripts/install-global.sh` adds export to shell profiles with marker-based idempotency
  - Shell profile modification detects user's shell (bash/zsh) and adds export only once
- Agent workflows updated with path persistence:
  - `/agentic setup` now writes `agentic_global_path` to `.agentic-config.json`
  - `/agentic update` refreshes persistence locations during update
  - `/agentic migrate` sets up persistence during migration
- AGENTS.md simplified with conditional documentation pattern (detailed docs in `docs/`)
- `/branch` command now uses spec-resolver.sh for automatic path resolution
- All `/spec` stage files (CREATE, RESEARCH, PLAN, PLAN_REVIEW, IMPLEMENT, REVIEW, TEST, DOCUMENT) now use `commit_spec_changes` for spec commits
- Dry-run enforcement migrated from instruction-based to hook-based
  - Removed AGENTS.md dry-run verification section (replaced by pretooluse hook)
  - Hard enforcement at Claude Code tool level prevents accidental file modifications
- `/agentic update` nightly mode now requires explicit `nightly` argument
  - No longer auto-infers nightly mode based on version matching
  - Clear semantics: `/agentic update nightly` for symlink rebuild
- `/full-life-cycle-pr` and `/o_spec` session handling improved
  - No longer archives in-progress sessions when starting fresh
  - Prevents conflicts with parallel agents from `/orc`, `/spawn`, `/po_spec`
  - Sessions naturally become stale over time without destructive cleanup

### Fixed

- Removed redundant empty string check in spec-resolver.sh (line 204 unreachable due to `${VAR:-default}` handling empty strings)
- Fixed pattern match false-positive in spec-resolver.sh when `EXT_SPECS_LOCAL_PATH` is empty (guards against `*"//specs/"*` false matches)
- Added git reset on commit failure in spec-resolver.sh to unstage files after failed commits (prevents partial state)
- Standardized timestamp format in version-manager.sh to UTC ISO 8601 (`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) eliminating GNU/BSD date timezone inconsistencies
- **Critical**: Config file lookup now uses project root instead of global installation path
  - Added `get_project_root()` function to `agentic-root.sh` for proper project discovery
  - `config-loader.sh` now uses `get_project_root()` for `.env` and `.agentic-config.conf.yml`
  - `spec-resolver.sh` now uses `get_project_root()` for spec directory paths
  - `external-specs.sh` now uses `get_project_root()` for `.specs` directory
  - Previously: all projects using development repo as global install inherited its `.env` config
  - Now: each project correctly loads its own configuration files
- spec-resolver.sh pure bash depth calculation - replaced `tr`/`wc` with `${parent_dir//[!\/]/}` pattern for restricted shell compatibility
- external-specs.sh trap-based lock cleanup - added `trap '_release_lock "$lockdir"' EXIT` to prevent lock leaks on failure paths
- path-persistence.sh path validation - validates install path contains only safe characters `[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]+` before writing to shell profile (prevents shell injection)
- install.sh git clean flag - removed `-x` flag to preserve gitignored files (changed from `git clean -fdx` to `git clean -fd`)
- config-loader.sh unbalanced quote handling - removed contradictory stripping code that violated "leave as-is" comment
- update-config.sh relative symlinks in self-hosted mode - uses relative paths when target is repository root per PROJECT_AGENTS.md requirement
- Path resolution documentation in AGENTS.md and templates - clarified distinction between project root (`$PWD`) and global agentic installation (`$AGENTIC_CONFIG_PATH` or `~/.agents/agentic-config`)
  - Replaced confusing traversal pattern with explicit AGENTIC_GLOBAL pattern across 20 files
  - Updated all spec stage agents (CREATE, PLAN, RESEARCH, PLAN_REVIEW, IMPLEMENT, REVIEW, DOCUMENT, TEST) to use AGENTIC_GLOBAL
  - Updated command files (branch, o_spec, po_spec) to use AGENTIC_GLOBAL
  - Updated docs/external-specs-storage.md to document new pattern
  - CRITICAL note added: `core/` does NOT exist at project root (only specific commands are symlinked)
- IMPLEMENT spec stage now enforces `spec(NNN): IMPLEMENT - <title>` format on ALL commits (was missing on first commit)
- Hook execution in non-Python projects - added `--no-project` flag to all `uv run` hook commands
  - Fixed in `.claude/settings.json`, `scripts/setup-config.sh`, `.claude/commands/init.md`, `scripts/update-config.sh`
  - Prevents "project not found" errors when hooks run in directories without `pyproject.toml`
- Hook path resolution when Claude changes working directory
  - Hook command now uses absolute paths instead of relative paths
  - `dry-run-guard.py` accepts project root as CLI argument
  - Prevents "No such file or directory" errors when CWD differs from project root
  - Updated in `setup-config.sh`, `update-config.sh`, `init.md`, and hook script
