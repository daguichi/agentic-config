# Changelog

All notable changes to agentic-config.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- `/o_spec` workflow modifiers: `full` (default), `normal`, `lean`, `leanest` for speed/quality tradeoffs
- `/o_spec` step skipping with `--skip=STEP1,STEP2` flag
- `/fork-terminal` command for opening new kitty terminal sessions with optional prime prompt
- `/agentic update nightly` option to rebuild all symlinks even when version matches
- `/milestone` Phase 0.7 and Phase 4.5 for PROJECT_AGENTS.md rules enforcement on release changes
- PROJECT_AGENTS.md symlink relative paths enforcement rule

### Fixed
- `/o_spec` missing YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint, project-agnostic)

### Changed
- `/agentic update` now shows change summary table before options
- Renamed "Force update" to "Full Update" (less aggressive language)
- Added safe "Update" option for symlink-only updates when no template conflicts
- Improved safety messaging with explicit backup guarantees

## [0.1.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- `/worktree` command for creating git worktrees with asset symlinks and environment setup
- `/rebase` command for rebasing current branch onto target
- `/squash_and_rebase` command for squash + rebase in one operation
- `git-rewrite-history` skill for safe git history manipulation
- CHANGELOG.md handling in `/milestone` release workflow

### Fixed
- `git init` now checks if inside ANY git repo (including parent repos) before initializing
- Create `.installations.json` if missing before jq update (was causing setup to fail)
- `/worktree` now resolves `assets.source` relative to `.worktree.yml` location (not CWD)
- `/branch` creates spec dir relative to CWD (not repo root) and commits it
- `/worktree` spec dir no longer lost after worktree creation (requires committed state)
- `/worktree` commits setup changes at end to avoid unstaged files
- Backup existing skill directories before symlink replacement

### Changed
- Setup preserves pre-existing config content to `PROJECT_AGENTS.md`
- `/worktree` uses haiku agents for parallel environment setup
- Removed emojis from scripts and agent definitions for consistency

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- `/init` command for post-clone setup (creates symlinks + global install)
- `/branch` command for new branch with spec directory structure
- Quickstart section in README for new contributors

### Changed
- All commands/skills now installed by default (removed `--extras` flag)
- `/spec` removed from global install (project-specific only)
- Symlinks converted from absolute to relative paths (portable)
- Self-hosted repo detection in update script

### Fixed
- Symlinks now work after cloning to any directory

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-15

### Added
